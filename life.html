  <p><strong>The Rules of the Game</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
  </ol>
